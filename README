Notes on Part 3

Flow Monitoring for string search

Need way to keep track of which flows are open and which ones we are monitoring 

Once flow open with every data packet search for keyword search entire TCP payload

Buffering packets
Between packets need to store last one we got

Length of search string could be longer than one packet
how many packets to store = max[floor(SearchString/PacketSize), 2]

Need to monitor outgoing and ingoing connection seperately

Need to figure out how to append to a file and flush its cache, might need to just use close for flushing class

Handle timeouts
